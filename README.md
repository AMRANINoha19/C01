C01 - 1337 Network Piscine

📌 Project Overview
This is the second C project in the 1337 Piscine. It builds upon the basics from C00 and dives deeper into:

1.String manipulation

2.Writing functions that handle arrays and characters

3.Understanding function prototypes and file separation

4.Handling corner cases and validating input manually



📁 Files and Functions
File	Description

ex00/ft_putchar.c	Writes a single character to the output using write().

ex01/ft_print_alphabet.c	Prints all lowercase letters from a to z. (Reinforcement)

ex02/ft_print_reverse_alphabet.c	Prints all lowercase letters from z to a. (Reinforcement)

ex03/ft_print_numbers.c	Prints numbers from 0 to 9.

ex04/ft_is_negative.c	Prints 'P' for positive and 'N' for negative.

ex05/ft_print_comb.c	Prints all possible combinations of three digits.

ex06/ft_print_comb2.c	Prints combinations of two two-digit numbers.

ex07/ft_putnbr.c	Displays a number using only write.

ex08/ft_print_combn.c	Displays all possible combinations of n digits.




🛠 Skills Practiced
*Writing robust custom functions

*Loop logic and nested loops

*Handling ASCII characters and character arrays

*Edge case handling (like negative numbers, max/min values)

*Respecting Norminette rules




🧠 What I Learned
!How to manipulate strings and characters without using standard library functions

!The importance of testing edge cases and validating function output manually

!Building a deeper understanding of how memory and characters work in C
